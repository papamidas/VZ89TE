- add a new project for board type ARDUINO UNO
- add a subdirectory named "VZ89TE" to the lib folder of your platformio project or clone this repository into the lib folder
- copy main.cpp from the example folder to the src folder of your platformio project

hardware:

1. Arduino UNO
2. Multifuncion shield
3. Air Quality Sensor MICS-VZ-89TE, connected to 3v3/GND and SCL/SDA of your Arduino. Do not forget pullup-resistors between SCL,SCA and 3v3.
